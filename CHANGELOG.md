## [0.1.0a3] — 2026-05-02

Pre-launch test build. Sponsio is a runtime contract enforcement layer
for AI agents: deterministic LTL contracts evaluated as a compiled DFA
on every tool call, with framework adapters for the common agent stacks
and a CLI for scanning, mining, and reporting.

### Added

- **Runtime engine** — LTL → DFA compiler, finite-trace evaluator,
  observe / enforce modes, session log writer, OTel exporter.
- **Pattern library** — 29 deterministic patterns (`must_precede`,
  `rate_limit`, `idempotent`, `arg_blacklist`, `arg_allowlist`,
  `no_data_leak`, `segregation_of_duty`, `cooldown`, `must_confirm`,
  `bounded_retry`, `loop_detection`, `scope_limit`,
  `arg_length_limit`, `data_intact`, `destructive_action_gate`, etc.)
  exposed both as Python factories and as natural-language triggers.
- **Contract bundles** — `sponsio:core/runaway`, `sponsio:core/universal`,
  `sponsio:capability/shell`, `sponsio:capability/filesystem`,
  `sponsio:incident/openclaw`, plus benchmark packs
  (`sponsio:benchmark/redcode_exec`, `sponsio:benchmark/odcv_bench`).
- **Framework integrations** — LangGraph / LangChain.js, Claude Agent
  SDK, OpenAI SDK, OpenAI Agents SDK, Google ADK, Vercel AI SDK,
  CrewAI, MCP, plus a no-framework `guard_before` / `guard_after` API.
- **CLI** — `sponsio onboard`, `scan`, `validate`, `check`, `report`,
  `refresh`, `eval`, `export`, `export-sessions`, `host`, `plugin`,
  `packs`, `patterns`, `prompt`, `mode`, `doctor`, `skill`, `replay`,
  `explain`, `demo`.
- **TypeScript SDK** (`@sponsio/sdk`) — deterministic engine + the
  same set of framework integrations.
- **Static scanner** (`@sponsio/scan-ts`) — AST-based code scanner
  for proposing contracts from a TS / JS codebase.
- **Local observability** — session log JSONL writer,
  `sponsio host trace --follow` live stream, `sponsio report` rich /
  markdown / HTML / JSON output, OTel HTTP exporter for shipping to
  your own collector.
- **Plugins** — Claude Code plugin (production), OpenClaw plugin
  (beta — type definitions track the public OpenClaw plugin docs;
  end-to-end exercise inside a live OpenClaw runtime is in progress).
- **Benchmarks** — ODCV-Bench (84.5% high-risk protection across 12
  LLMs) and RedCode-Exec (92% combined detection across 1,410 cases),
  with 0% utility FP on the 60-file clean-code audit. See
  [`docs/BENCHMARKS.md`](docs/BENCHMARKS.md).

### Boundary

Sponsio Cloud is a separate commercial product layer; the
[OSS / Cloud boundary](docs/oss_scope.md) is documented and committed.
The OSS engine ships everything above; the managed sto pipeline,
cross-customer pattern intelligence, hosted dashboard, and
multi-tenant retention live in `sponsio[cloud]`. The OSS monitor
log-and-skips sto contracts with a one-time warning so libraries that
mix det + sto load cleanly under either install.

### Notes

- Status: alpha. APIs may shift before 1.0; the trace event schema
  and CLI surface follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for breaking
  changes from 0.2 onward.
- Apache 2.0 — see [LICENSE](LICENSE) and the
  [OSS Promise](docs/oss_scope.md#versioning--the-oss-promise).
