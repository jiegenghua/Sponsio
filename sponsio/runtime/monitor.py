"""RuntimeMonitor -- intercepts agent actions and enforces contracts at runtime.

This is the central enforcement point.  Every agent action flows through
``check_action()``, which runs two independent evaluation pipelines:

Det pipeline (formal, binary):
    action -> append to trace -> ground(trace) -> for each Contract:
        eval assumption -> if holds, eval enforcement
    -> pass:  action allowed
    -> fail:  DetBlock or EscalateToHuman

Sto pipeline (probabilistic, graded):
    action -> for each sto-enforcement Contract whose assumption holds:
        StoEvaluator -> StoResult(score, evidence, suggestion)
    -> score >= threshold:  pass
    -> score <  threshold:  RetryWithConstraint or RedirectToSafe

Det violations NEVER use sto strategies (and vice versa).  This is
enforced in ``_check_det`` and ``_check_sto``.

Each ``Contract`` is a single (assumption, enforcement) pair. Contracts
are evaluated independently — an assumption on one contract never gates
the enforcement of another contract.

    *outside* the lock so a slow exporter (dashboard HTTP, OTel) can't

        :meth:`reset` — trace, log, spans, verifier cache, and atom
        caches are all cleared; contracts on the underlying
        :class:`~sponsio.models.system.System` are **not** touched.
        The only difference is intent signalling and the return value:
        callers get back the headline metrics of the window that just
        closed so they can plumb them into audit logs / dashboards
        before the numbers go away.

        Why not just keep using :meth:`reset`?
        ``reset`` reads as "something went wrong, start over".
        ``rotate_session`` is the name you want to see at a quarterly
        review — "we rotate every 1000 turns to cap memory; here's the
        hand-off record."

        Liveness caveat
        ---------------
        Formulas that span the **entire trace** — ``F(tool)`` /
        ``always_followed_by(a, b)`` / whole-trace ``rate_limit(tool, N)``
        — lose visibility across the rotation boundary. Concretely: if
        ``response`` was promised before ``rotate_session`` and still
        hasn't happened, the post-rotation verifier won't see the
        original ``trigger`` and can never fire the liveness violation.
        To avoid silently eating obligations, this method refuses to
        rotate while ``finish_session`` hasn't been called on a guard
        with pending liveness obligations — but since ``RuntimeMonitor``
        doesn't know about guard-level ``finish_session``, the check
        has to happen one layer up. See
        :meth:`sponsio.integrations.base.BaseGuard.rotate_session` for
        the guard-side handling: run ``finish_session`` first, then
        rotate.
