    Action discriminator semantics — what each value contracts about

    rendering the result back into framework primitives:

    action         tool runs?    agent informed?    expected agent reaction

    ``retrying``   no            yes (lesson)       regenerate with ``retry_hint``
    ``escalated``  paused        depends            wait (may unblock via approval)
    ``redirected`` substituted   no (transparent)   continue, sees ``fallback_action``
    ``warned``     yes           no (log only)      no change
    ``allowed``    yes           —                  no enforcement, normal pass
    ``observed``   yes           —                  shadow-mode downgrade of any of

    =============  ============  =================  ===============================

    Attributes:
        action: What enforcement action was taken. See the table above
            for the agent-side semantics each value commits to.
        message: Human-facing explanation — for logs, dashboards,
            session-log entries. NOT the right thing to inject into the
            agent's next turn (use ``agent_msg`` for that).
        retry_prompt: Legacy field — the discriminative feedback for
            sto retry. New code should populate ``retry_hint`` instead;
            we keep ``retry_prompt`` populated for backwards-compat
            with integrations that already read it.
        fallback_action: Substitute action for ``redirected`` — opaque
            payload the integration injects in place of the original
            tool result (string, dict, structured object — depends on
            framework).
        score: Sto-pipeline extra — confidence score that triggered
            this result. ``None`` for det.
        threshold: Sto-pipeline extra — the threshold the score missed.
            ``None`` for det.
        rule_id: Stable identifier for the contract / pattern that
            fired (``DetFormula.pattern_name``, contract id, sto atom
            name). Lets integrations group "violations of the same
            rule" without parsing free-text messages.
        agent_msg: What the agent should see on its next turn. Should
            be phrased to nudge the LLM toward the right reaction:
            blocked → "this action was rejected, choose another";
            retrying → "your output failed X, try again with Y".
            Defaults to empty; integrations fall back to ``message``
            when not set.
        retry_hint: Concrete "to fix this, do <X>" guidance attached
            to ``retrying`` outcomes. Distinct from ``agent_msg`` so
            integrations can format the two parts differently (e.g.
            agent_msg as a tool-error body, retry_hint as a follow-up
            instruction).
        alternatives: Suggested replacement actions for ``blocked`` /
            ``redirected``. Optional — integrations can render as a
            list to the agent ("try one of: <a>, <b>, <c>").

    Centralises the message / agent_msg / hint phrasing so each
    strategy doesn't reinvent string formatting. Two reasons we keep
    this separate from the strategies:

    1. **Message phrasing decides agent behaviour.** The same
       constraint can produce "this is forbidden" (agent abandons) or
       "this didn't pass X, try Y" (agent retries). Putting the
       phrasing here lets us tune block / retry voice consistently.
    2. **Integrations need structured fields.** Free-text messages
       force adapters to regex-parse to extract anything useful. The
       builder fills ``rule_id`` / ``alternatives`` / ``retry_hint``
       so adapters can render natively (Claude Agent
       ``permissionDecision``, OpenAI synthetic tool result, CrewAI
       error dict) without string archaeology.
