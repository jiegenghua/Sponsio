"""Lightweight ANSI spinner for long stderr-emit gaps.

Used by the CLI progress sink to indicate that a multi-second wait
(LLM inference, doctor probes, trace replay) is alive rather than
hung.  Pure stdlib — no yaspin / halo / rich dependency — so onboard
stays light.

Usage::

    from sponsio.runtime.spinner import Spinner

    spinner = Spinner()
    spinner.start("· Running LLM inference (...)…")
    do_long_work()
    spinner.stop("· LLM inference done in 15.7s")

Skips silently when stderr isn't a TTY (CI / pipe / docker entrypoint),
falling back to a single immediate print of the label so structured
output stays uncorrupted.

The braille frames match yaspin / ora / spinning_wheels visually so
users coming from those tools get the expected effect.  Cadence is
10 Hz — the same default — fast enough to feel alive, slow enough
that piping into a slow terminal doesn't choke.
