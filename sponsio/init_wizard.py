"""``sponsio init`` — interactive 4-axis onboarding wizard.

One entry point for first-time setup that covers all four install axes
in a single coherent flow:

1. **Framework wrap** (single) — which agent framework's tools to wrap
   (langgraph / crewai / openai / claude_agent / ... / none).
2. **Protect host agents** (multi) — which IDE host hooks to install
   (claude-code / cursor / openclaw).
3. **Install Sponsio skill** (multi) — which IDEs get the SKILL.md
   drop (axis 2's ``--with-skill`` default already covers picked hosts).
4. **Mode** (single) — enforce (default, block) vs observe (shadow).

Two surfaces converge on the same dispatch table:

* **TTY**: ``sponsio init`` — sequential ``click.prompt`` /
  ``click.confirm`` (matches ``onboard_setup.py``'s style — no new
  dependency).  Header / section rules render via the existing
  :mod:`sponsio.render.components` primitives so the wizard panel
  matches Sponsio's runtime trace style.

* **Non-TTY**: ``sponsio init --plan '<picks>'`` for dry-run preview,
  ``sponsio init --apply '<picks>'`` for execution.  Used by the
  IDE-agent-driven onboarding wizard prompt — both paths share the
  same :class:`InitPicks` dataclass + :func:`plan_commands` mapping,
  so the CLI dry-run and the IDE-agent dry-run are guaranteed to
  match.

Why this isn't fused into ``sponsio onboard``:

* ``sponsio onboard`` is the library-style API for ONE project's
  framework-wrap; it doesn't know about host hooks or skill drops.
  ``sponsio init`` is the higher-level orchestrator that ALSO calls
  ``host install`` / ``skill install`` per the user's axis picks.
  Keeping them separate means each command stays focused; ``init``
  calls ``onboard`` (and the other two) under the hood.

The previous single-axis wizard (provider / judge / mode prompts → wrote
``sponsio.yaml`` directly) was deprecated in favour of this design.
``sponsio onboard --interactive`` + ``.sponsiorc`` already covers
provider/api-key configuration, so we don't need a parallel surface.
