"""``sponsio doctor`` — one-shot environment + wiring smoke test.

The goal is to turn first-run ambiguity into a single, actionable
command:

    $ sponsio doctor
    • Python           3.11.8
    ✓ sponsio import    0.2.0a0
    ✓ Optional SDKs     langchain, openai (crewai not installed — ok)
    ✓ LLM credentials   GOOGLE_API_KEY present (gemini-2.5-flash-lite, 1500/day free)
    ✓ Project scan      12 tools found in src/
    ✓ Guard smoke-test  contract wires up, data_write visible
    ✓ Runtime mode      observe (shadow — safe default)

    All core checks passed.  Next: ``sponsio scan src/ --out sponsio.yaml``

Each check is a standalone function returning ``CheckResult``.  No check
ever raises — they report ``fail`` / ``skip`` / ``warn`` instead, so
the command always prints a full report even on a broken machine.
