"""Pattern library -- the user-facing constraint DSL.

Users describe constraints by calling pattern functions.  Each function
compiles a human-readable description into an LTL formula wrapped in a
``DetFormula`` (which carries the description + pattern name for
diagnostics).

Users never need to write raw LTL.  The NL parser
(``generation/nl_to_contract.py``) maps natural language strings to
calls into this library.

Available patterns (35 det + 1 deprecated):

  Core temporal (14):
    must_precede(A, B)              -- A must happen before B
    always_followed_by(A, B)        -- whenever A, eventually B
    never_together(A, B)            -- [DEPRECATED → mutual_exclusion]
    no_reversal(A, B)               -- B forbidden after A commits
    requires_permission(tool, perm) -- tool needs permission
    no_data_leak(src, ext)          -- no flow from src to ext
    mutual_exclusion(A, B)          -- at most one ever called
    rate_limit(action, N)           -- action called at most N times
    idempotent(action)              -- action may occur at most once
    deadline(trigger, action, N)    -- action within N steps of trigger
    must_confirm(action)            -- confirmation before action
    cooldown(action, N)             -- min N steps between calls
    segregation_of_duty(A, B)       -- same agent can't do both
    bounded_retry(action, N)        -- at most N retries
    loop_detection(action, N)       -- max N consecutive calls

  Argument / path (5):
    arg_blacklist(tool, param, patterns) -- forbid patterns in tool args
    arg_allowlist(tool, param, patterns) -- arg must match one of the allowed patterns
    scope_limit(tool, allowed)      -- restrict tool to allowed paths
    arg_length_limit(tool, param, N)-- max N chars in argument field
    data_intact(tool, paths)        -- tool must use original data

  OWASP agentic security (8):
    destructive_action_gate(tool, role)       -- human approval + role
    untrusted_source_gate(sources, sinks)     -- re-confirm after untrusted input
    required_steps_completion(trigger, steps) -- all steps must follow trigger
    tool_allowlist(tools)                     -- only listed tools allowed
    dangerous_bash_commands(forbidden)        -- preset: ban shell commands
    dangerous_sql_verbs(tool, forbidden)      -- preset: ban SQL verbs
    irreversible_once(action)                 -- at most once per session
    confirm_after_source(source, action)      -- confirm after untrusted source

  Resource / delegation (3):
    token_budget(max_tokens, scope)           -- limit token consumption
    arg_value_range(tool, field, min, max)    -- constrain numeric args
    delegation_depth_limit(max_depth)         -- limit delegation chain

  Workflow hygiene (6):
    dry_run_before_commit(dry_run, commit)          -- dry-run before commit
    backup_before_destructive(backup, action)       -- backup before destructive action
    audit_after(action, audit)                      -- audit/log must follow action
    approval_freshness(approval, action, N)         -- approval expires after N steps
    sanitized_before_sink(source, sanitizer, sink)  -- sanitizer after source before sink
    duplicate_call_limit(tool, pattern, N)          -- cap repeated matching calls

    Regex variant of :func:`ctx_required` for cases where the allowed
    set is better expressed as a pattern (e.g. ``spiffe://prod/.*``,
    ``^canonical:/v[0-9]+$``) than an exhaustive list.

    Covers: same ASI slice as ``ctx_required`` — identity / content-
    source / signed-message gating where the valid value set is open-
    ended.

                             r"^spiffe://prod/.*")

# Sentinel: when ``P`` was never emitted, grounding returns ``1e18``

    Compiles to::

        G(time_since(predicate_key) ≤ max_seconds)

    Pair this with another temporal pattern via ``&`` to gate an
    action on a recent occurrence — e.g. an approval that's still
    fresh::

        # "refund only allowed within 1h of an active senior_eng approval"
        gate = G(Implies(
            _called("refund"),
            Le(Var("time_since", "ctx(approval.role, senior_eng)"), Const(3600))
        ))

    The ``predicate_key`` argument is the *grounded* key string
    (``"called(refund)"``, ``"ctx(approval.role, alice)"``, ``"flow(rag,
    answer)"``) — i.e. what ``Atom.key()`` would produce for the
    predicate you want to time. We require the explicit string rather
    than an Atom because ``time_since`` covers the union of every atom
    family (called / ctx / flow / contains / segment / …) and we don't
    want to re-derive each family's key shape here.

    Args:
        predicate_key: Grounded predicate key string. Use ``Atom(...).key()``
            or ``pred_key(...)`` to build it if unsure.
        max_seconds: Maximum allowed delta (event-clock seconds). Use
            integer ts if the integration is ticking events with a
            logical clock — the comparison is unitless.
