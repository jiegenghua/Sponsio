"""OpenAI SDK integration — auto-enforce contracts on tool_calls.

Generic fallback for users who use the OpenAI SDK directly without
an agent framework like LangGraph or CrewAI.

Usage::

    from sponsio import contract
    from sponsio.openai import patch_openai

    guard = patch_openai(contracts=[
        contract("policy gate before refund")
            .assume("called `issue_refund`")
            .enforce("must call `check_policy` before `issue_refund`"),
        contract("refund rate limit")
            .enforce("tool `issue_refund` at most 1 times"),
    ])

    # All tool_calls are now auto-monitored
    client = openai.OpenAI()
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[...],
        tools=[...],
    )
    # If a tool_call violates a contract, it is marked in guard.violations

Two enforcement hooks run automatically:

* **Before** the tool executes — ``check_response`` inspects every
  ``tool_call`` in the model's output and enforces det contracts
  (``must_precede``, ``rate_limit``, ``mutual_exclusion``, …).
* **After** the tool executes — when the user feeds the tool result
  back in as a ``{"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": ..., "content": ...}``
  message on the next ``chat.completions.create``, the patch scans
  those messages and runs ``guard_after`` on each.  This powers sto
  constraints (``tone_professional``, ``injection_free``) and the
  ``BaseGuard`` auto-tag layer (``contains(tool_name)``, optional
  PII detection) without the user touching anything.

If you're not going through ``patch_openai`` — e.g. you use the raw
response plus your own executor — call ``guard.observe_tool_result``
explicitly after each tool execution.

You can also check results programmatically::

    guard.violations       # list of all violations
    guard.last_check       # CheckResult from the most recent response
    guard.summary()        # human-readable summary

    """Best-effort decode of an OpenAI ``tool_call.function.arguments`` payload.

    OpenAI returns ``arguments`` as a JSON-encoded *string*. When a model
    hallucinates malformed JSON (truncation, prompt-injection nudging it to
    inject control characters, function-calling format slips, …) the
    previous behavior was a silent ``args = {}`` — every content-aware
    contract (``arg_blacklist``, ``arg_field_has``, ``arg_value_range``,
    ``arg_length_exceeds``, …) then *vacuously* passes because the field
    it inspects doesn't exist. That is precisely the wrong failure mode
    for a security boundary.

    This helper:

    * Returns the parsed dict when ``raw`` is valid JSON.
    * Returns ``{}`` for empty / ``None`` arguments (the legitimate
      "no args" case).
    * Otherwise emits a ``UserWarning`` and falls back to a sentinel
      payload that **preserves the raw bytes** so coarser contracts
      (``arg_has`` regex over the serialized payload) can still match::

            "_sponsio_unparseable": True,
            "_raw_arguments": <original_string>,

    Operators who want a malformed-args attempt to *block* (rather than
    just warn + degrade) can set ``SPONSIO_OPENAI_STRICT_TOOL_ARGS=1``
    in the environment; the helper then raises ``ValueError`` from the
    caller's ``check_response`` site.
