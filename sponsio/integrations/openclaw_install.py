"""OpenClaw install/uninstall — deploy the sponsio-openclaw plugin
into ``~/.openclaw/extensions/`` AND bootstrap the
``~/.sponsio/plugins/_host_openclaw/sponsio.yaml`` library so OpenClaw
agents see Sponsio's defaults.

Surfaced behind ``sponsio host install openclaw``.

Three things happen at install time, all idempotent:

1. **Fallback contract library** — write
   ``~/.sponsio/plugins/_host_openclaw/sponsio.yaml`` so the plugin
   has a default ruleset to evaluate against for tools whose name
   doesn't match a per-plugin namespace.

2. **OpenClaw extension** — copy the pre-built TS plugin
   (``openclaw.plugin.json`` + ``package.json`` + ``dist/index.js``)
   from the wheel's bundled ``sponsio/plugin/openclaw_artifact/``
   into ``~/.openclaw/extensions/sponsio-openclaw/``.  The OpenClaw
   plugin discovery path picks it up on next start.

3. **Plugin registration** — patch ``~/.openclaw/openclaw.json``'s
   ``plugins.entries.sponsio-openclaw = { enabled: true }`` so
   OpenClaw activates the plugin on next start.  The original
   ``openclaw.json`` is backed up to ``openclaw.json.before-sponsio``
   on first install only — re-runs do not overwrite the backup.

Docker scenarios (OpenClaw-in-container, with sponsio CLI absent
inside the container) need additional steps the host installer
deliberately doesn't take.  See the demo's ``setup_openclaw.sh``
for the docker-specific path.
