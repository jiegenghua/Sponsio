"""Minimal trace replay for OSS `sponsio validate --traces`.

Given a compiled formula and a list of traces, returns pass / fail
counts and pass_rate.  Counts only — no per-fail attribution, no
stratification by decision, no repair suggestions.  Those richer
features live in the proprietary ``sponsio-pro`` package
(see ``docs/internal/proprietary-validation-pipeline.md``).

Used by ``sponsio validate --traces`` to give OSS users a basic
"would this contract have hit historical traffic" report before they
flip to enforce mode.

            wrappers from the pattern library).

        the replay — the return value's ``error_count`` reports them.
