"""Regression tests that pin ``SKILL.md`` to the actual CLI surface.

The bundled Agent Skill (``sponsio/skills/sponsio/SKILL.md``) makes
concrete promises about CLI subcommands and their flags — that's what
the agent dispatches on at runtime.  If the CLI drifts and the skill
doesn't, Cursor / Claude Code will paste syntax that doesn't exist.

These tests enforce two invariants:

A. **Public API surface contract** — the commands + flags the skill
   declares in its "Public API surface" section must actually exist
   in ``sponsio --help``.  Written as an explicit ``SURFACE`` table
   (not parsed from markdown) so the test is self-documenting and
   readable when it fails.

B. **No orphaned examples** — every ``sponsio <subcommand>`` that
   appears inside a code block in SKILL.md must map to a registered
   click subcommand.  Cheap way to catch typos like "sponsio repot"
   or mentions of commands that were removed.

Update these tests when you intentionally change the skill's
CLI contract; CI fails here precisely because that change matters.
