"""Tests for the D / F / G quality fixes called out in the original
pack review.

Why these matter individually:

* **D** — `arg_blacklist` regexes that match too broadly cause
  day-1 false positives, which is the fastest way to get an entire
  contract pack disabled.  Pin the *non-matches* (the safe paths
  that must NOT trip the rule) so future regex tweaks don't
  silently re-broaden the scope.
* **F** — the strict 1:1 confirm-to-exec ratio breaks legitimate
  batch-approval workflows.  Pin the doc-comment that points users
  at the override + replacement pattern, since that's the only
  guidance preventing them from disabling the whole pack.
* **G** — stochastic ``beta`` values without rationale comments
  prompt "why this number?" questions that erode trust in the
  pack's defaults.  Pin that the rationale text exists.

Plus a smoke check: every pack must still load cleanly after these
changes — quality fixes that broke loading would be net-negative.
