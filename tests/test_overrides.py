"""Tests for the ``overrides:`` section — disable / tweak individual
contracts pulled in via ``include:`` without forking the pack.

Why overrides matter: the value prop of shipped contract packs
(``sponsio:capability/shell`` etc.) collapses if the only way to
disagree with a single rule is to copy-paste the whole pack.
``overrides:`` keeps the pack as the source of truth and lets
each host say "all of that, except this one rule which I want
disabled / tightened / scoped differently".

What's pinned here:

* **Match shape** — every supported match key (`desc`, `pack_source`,
  `source`, `pattern`); AND-semantics across keys; non-empty match
  required (empty would silently apply to everything).
* **Effect shape** — `disabled: true` drops the contract; field
  edits (`threshold`, `prompt_override`, `context_scope`) write back
  to the enforcement constraint.  Mixing `disabled` with edits is
  rejected (the edits would be dead code).
* **Drift catch** — unmatched override rules raise `ConfigError`
  listing them.  This is the whole point of strict matching: pack
  version bumps shouldn't silently re-enable rules the user
  intentionally turned off.
* **End-to-end** — overrides applied via `load_config` against the
  shipped shell pack work as expected.

Schema reminder::

    overrides:
      - match: {desc: "Ban recursive deletes of sensitive roots"}
        disabled: true
      - match: {pack_source: "sponsio:capability/shell"}
        threshold: 0.85
