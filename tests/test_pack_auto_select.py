"""Tests for ``select_packs`` and the wider auto-selection path in
``run_onboard``.

Onboarding's value prop hinges on the user landing in a state where
useful contracts are already in place after one command.  The
contract packs (``sponsio:core/universal`` etc.) are how we get
there — but only if they're picked automatically.  Asking users to
read pack docs and copy include lines defeats the smoothness goal
that motivated this whole feature.

What's pinned here:

* **Universal always selected.**  The universal pack applies to
  every LLM agent, so it should never be omitted.
* **Runaway gated by framework.**  Only multi-step / agentic-loop
  frameworks need budget controls; one-shot completion calls don't.
* **Capability packs gated by tool names.**  Shell pack picked when
  a tool name resembles shell exec (`bash`, `run_command`, …);
  filesystem pack picked when names resemble file IO (`read_file`,
  `write_file`, …).
* **Tool-rename pre-populated.**  When a host's tool name differs
  from the pack's canonical name (`bash` vs `exec`), `tool_rename`
  is filled in so included rules apply out of the box without
  manual edits.
* **`workspace:` propagated.**  Selecting the filesystem pack
  triggers a `workspace:` line so the load-time placeholder check
  passes.
* **End-to-end via `run_onboard` produces a config that loads
  cleanly** — the strongest possible signal that the auto-selection
  picks integrate with the rest of the loader.
