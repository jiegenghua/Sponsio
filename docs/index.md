# Sponsio documentation

This is the reference manual for Sponsio. For the pitch, the benchmarks, and a 30-second install, see the [README](../README.md).

If you are just getting started, the fastest path is:

```bash
pip install sponsio
sponsio demo --scenario freeze --fast
sponsio onboard .
```

Then pick a track below.

## Three tracks

| | |
|---|---|
| **[Concepts](concepts/overview.md)** — how Sponsio models contracts, traces, atoms, and the two pipelines. Read this before writing your first custom contract. |
| **[Integrations](integrations/index.md)** — wire Sponsio into LangGraph, Claude Agent SDK, OpenAI, OpenAI Agents, CrewAI, Google ADK, Vercel AI, MCP, or a custom tool-calling loop. |
| **[Reference](reference/cli.md)** — CLI, pattern catalog, `sponsio.yaml` schema, Python and TypeScript API. See [`oss_scope.md`](oss_scope.md) for the OSS / Sponsio Cloud boundary. |

## LLM-readable index

A flat, link-only index of this documentation is available at [`llms.txt`](../llms.txt) (short) and [`llms-full.txt`](../llms-full.txt) (full). Point an LLM assistant at either to give it a complete map of the project.
