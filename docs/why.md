# Why Sponsio

Sponsio operates at the **action boundary** — checking which tool a model is about to call, with what arguments, given everything that has already happened in the trace, *before any side effect fires*. That's a different position from every other guardrail category.

## Compared to other guardrail categories

| Approach                              | When it works                                               | Where it fails                                                                                           | How Sponsio solves                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prompt-injection Filters**          | Pre-generation, on input text                               | Drifts on novel phrasings; sees text, not tool calls; no notion of action history                        | Enforces *which* tools may run, *in what* order, *with what* arguments, before function call executes, with full trace context            |
| **Output Validators**                 | Post-generation, on response strings                        | The mistakes (e.g. refund, DB write, API call) may already have fired                                    | Blocks the call *before* execution; reasons over the full action history, not just the latest string                                      |
| **LLM-as-Judge**                      | Flexible, handles fuzzy properties; useful for offline eval | Stochastic verdicts, hundreds-of-ms latency, itself prompt-injectable — unsuitable as a synchronous gate | Sub-0.01ms deterministic checks, zero LLM in the hot path; stochastic pipeline is opt-in for fuzzy properties                             |
| **Sandboxing & Access Control Lists** | Strong perimeter for identity- and resource-level isolation | Narrows agent capability. Gates by *who* and *what resource*, not by *behavior sequence*                 | Enforces temporal contracts over the action sequence, including ordering, history, and multi-step invariants, preserving agent capability |

## Compared to other deterministic enforcers

**1. Temporal contracts over sequential actions, not stateless rule matching.** Existing enforcers evaluate each action in isolation. Sponsio reasons over the full trajectory: *"verify_recipient before send_email"*, *"no external calls after PII access"*, *"refund_payment ≤ 3 calls per session"*.

**2. Machine-checkable, not heuristic.** Contracts compile to LTL formulas, then to deterministic finite automata. Every verdict is a deterministic DFA transition, not a probabilistic confidence score. Same proof technique used in hardware verification (Intel FPU correctness, AWS S3 TLA+). [How it works →](concepts/formal-methods.md)

**3. Zero to protected in minutes, no DSL learning curve.** Existing tools require hand-written YAML / Rego / Cedar policies from scratch. Sponsio offers four paths in:

- **Auto-inferred** — `sponsio init` (interactive wizard) reads your tool signatures and writes starter contracts
- **Contract library** — include pre-built bundles by capability (`sponsio:capability/shell`, `…/filesystem`) or by incident (`sponsio:incident/openclaw`); each bundle composes 44 det patterns underneath (sto atoms ship in Sponsio Cloud)
- **Natural language** — `sponsio validate "..."` compiles plain English to LTL
- **Policy doc** — `sponsio scan --policy security.md` parses an existing compliance document

**4. Framework-agnostic and low-dependency.** Other tools ship as opinionated stacks — bundling identity, SRE, dashboards, orchestration. Sponsio is a single enforcement library that plugs in alongside whatever observability, IAM, and orchestration you already use.
