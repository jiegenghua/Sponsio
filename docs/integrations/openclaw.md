# OpenClaw integration

Sponsio plugs into the OpenClaw runtime as a host-level gate. Every `before_tool_call` event is checked against your active contracts before the tool fires, and every decision is streamed to your terminal.

## Install

The standard Python onboarding path is what you want. Paste the [Python one-shot prompt](../getting-started/onboard-prompt.md#python-project) into Claude Code / Codex / Cursor, and when the wizard asks about IDE hosts, pick `openclaw=full`. The wizard installs the `sponsio:incident/openclaw` bundle and wires up the host gate.

Or run the CLI yourself:

```bash
pip install sponsio
sponsio init .
# When prompted for IDE hosts, choose openclaw=full
```

## What you get

The bundled `sponsio:incident/openclaw` pack covers:

- **[CVE-2026-25253](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-25253)** — WebSocket 1-click RCE
- **[ClawHavoc](https://cyberpress.org/clawhavoc-poisons-openclaws-clawhub-with-1184-malicious-skills/)** — 1,184 malicious skills on ClawHub (Koi Security disclosure, Feb 2026)
- The `--yolo` flag
- The weather-skill `.env` exfil pattern ([Trend Micro write-up](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/26/b/openclaw-skills-used-to-distribute-atomic-macos-stealer.html))

45 mixed det/sto rules in total. See [`docs/reference/contract-lib.md`](../reference/contract-lib.md#sponsioincidentopenclaw) for the full rule list.

## Watch live blocks

Every Sponsio decision against your OpenClaw runtime streams here:

```bash
sponsio host trace openclaw --follow
```

Output format and filtering options: [`docs/reference/observability.md`](../reference/observability.md).

## Fork the pack

The OpenClaw bundle is also a worked example to fork from when authoring your own incident packs. Source: [`sponsio/contracts/incident/openclaw.yaml`](https://github.com/SponsioLabs/Sponsio/blob/main/sponsio/contracts/incident/openclaw.yaml).
