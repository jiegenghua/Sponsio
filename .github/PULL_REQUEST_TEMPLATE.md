## Checklist

- [ ] Tests added or updated (or N/A — docs/CI only).
- [ ] `pytest -v` passes locally.
- [ ] `ruff check sponsio/ tests/ examples/ scripts/` is clean.
- [ ] `ruff format --check sponsio/ tests/ examples/ scripts/` is clean.
- [ ] `README.md` updated if a user-visible surface changed (new
      pattern, integration, CLI command, or public API).
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` section updated if this is a
      user-visible change.
- [ ] No new external dependency added to `sponsio/` core (framework

- [ ] For new patterns: both `patterns/library.py` and
      `generation/nl_to_contract.py` updated.
- [ ] For new integrations: inherits `BaseGuard`; no duplicated
      pre/post-check logic.
